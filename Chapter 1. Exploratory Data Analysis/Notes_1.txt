Chapter 1. Exploratory Data Analysis


Elements of Structured Data
Data types: 
1. Numeric: continuous & discrete
2. Categorical
3. Ordinal: categorical data that has orders

Estimates of Location 
Mean, Trimmed Mean and Weighted Mean:
Mean is sensitive to outliers, trimmed mean eliminates the influence of extreme values because it drops a fixed number of sorted values at each end and then take an average of remaining values.
Weighted mean is calculated by multiplying each data value by a weight  and dividing their sum by the sum of the weights. Advantages: Some values are intrinsically more variable than others, and highly variable observations are given a lower weight; The data collected does not equally represent the different groups that we are interested in measuring. To correct that, we can give a higher weight to the values from the groups that were underrepresented.
Median
The median is the middle number on a sorted list of the data. It is referred to as a robust estimate of location since it is not influenced by outliers (extreme cases) that could skew the results.

Estimates of Variability
Variability measures if the data values are tightly clustered or spread out.
Deviation: The difference between the observed values and the estimated value.
 
 
Order statistics 
Range: the difference between the largest and smallest number. 
Percentile: Sorted the value and get the percentage values from the smallest value.  

Exploring the Data Distribution
Percentiles and boxplot
Frequency table and Histogram 
Density Plot
Correlation
Range from [-1, 1]. If the association is not linear, correlation coefficient may not be a useful matric.

Exploring Two or More Variables
Hexagonal binning
